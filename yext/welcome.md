# Welcome to Yext Engineering Orientation

We want you to feel productive as fast as possible so we've collected together the most important resources to get you up to speed. Together with your mentor, this learning path will get you well on your way! The first module gives you an overview of our toolset, the next one reviews how we develop our code, and the last module gives you a quick overview of the structure of our codebase.
