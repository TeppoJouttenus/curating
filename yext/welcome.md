# Yext Engineering Orientation

Welcome to Yext! I'm super excited about having you on board and I want you to feel productive as fast as possible. That's why we've collected together the most important resources to get you up to speed. Together with your mentor, this learning path will get you well on your way!

The first module gives you an overview of our toolset, the next one reviews how we develop our code, and the last module lays out the structure of our codebase.

If you have any feedback about this path, please let me know using the feedback bar at the right or just come chat with me. I want to continue to improve the path to make sure it's super helpful for new folks joining Yext.

Hope you have fun!
Sean
