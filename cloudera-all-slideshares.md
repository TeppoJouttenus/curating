## Keynote: The Journey to Pervasive Analytics

We are in the middle of a data rush. When you are right in the center of a storm, it can seem overwhelming. Where should I start? What do I need to think about? What is the best long-term bet? But don’t forget that more data should mean great news. More data should mean more insight, more guidance, and more strategic direction. However, more data doesn’t automatically rally your entire business around common goals and insights. You need a platform and architecture that can support a thriving, analytic-driven business culture that embraces a pervasive analytics strategy.

## Breakout: Hadoop and the Operational Data Store

As disparate data volumes continue to be operationalized across the enterprise, data will need to be processed, cleansed, transformed, and made available to end users at greater speeds. Traditional ODS systems run into issues when trying to process large data volumes causing operations to be backed up, data to be archived, and ETL&#x2F; ELT processes to fail. Join this breakout to learn how to battle these issues.

## Breakout: Operational Analytics with Hadoop

Operationalizing models and responding to large volumes of data, fast, requires bolt on systems that can struggle with processing (transforming the data), consistency (always responding to data), and scalability (processing and responding to large volumes of data). If the data volume become too large, these traditional systems fail to deliver their responses resulting in significant losses to organizations. Join this breakout to learn how to overcome the roadblocks.

## Breakout: Data Discovery with Hadoop

Siloed data is difficult to access and causes data consumers to only have partial views of the problem at hand. By limiting access to large volumes of disparate data, analysts and business users alike don’t have the ability to included important data in their reports and models leading to suboptimal analytic outputs. Even when this data is available to countless users, traditional systems limit them to querying small volumes of data in order to return the results in a timely matter.

## Data: Open for Good and Secure by Default | Eddie Garcia

Speaker: Eddie Garcia<br /><br />Open data is quickly gaining momentum and when applied as data for good, it becomes a much more powerful concept that we should all consider as good data stewards. Organizations to cities are starting to share data like traffic conditions or climate sensors and allowing others to use this open data to improve quality of life. But could this same open data be used for more nefarious reasons? Very likely so in this session we will bridge the balance between sharing data and locking it down, and how security should be on by default to protect all data including open data.

## Hadoop&#x27;s Impact on the Future of Data Management | Amr Awadallah

Speaker: Amr Awadallah<br /><br />As Hadoop and the surrounding projects &amp; vendors mature, their impact on the data management sector is growing. Amr will talk about his views on how that impact will change over the next five years. How central will Hadoop be to the data center of 2020? What industries will benefit most? Which technologies are at risk of displacement or encroachment?

## Upgrade Without the Headache: Best Practices for Upgrading Hadoop in Production

Walk through some of the best practices to keep in mind when it comes to upgrading your cluster, and learn how to leverage new Upgrade Wizard features in Cloudera Enterprise 5.3.<br /><br />For most mission critical workloads, downtime is never an option. Any downtime can have a direct impact on revenue and lead to frantic calls in the middle of the night. For this reason, upgrading the software that powers these workloads can often be a daunting task. It can cause unpredictable issues without access to support. That’s why an enterprise-grade administration tool is crucial for running Hadoop in production. Hadoop consists of dozens of components, running across multiple machines, all with their own configurations. That can lead to a lot of complexity and uncertainty - especially when taking the upgrade plunge.<br /><br />Cloudera Manager makes it easy and is the only production-ready administration tool for Hadoop. Not only does Cloudera Manager feature zero-downtime rolling upgrades, but it also has a built in Upgrade Wizard to make upgrades simple and predictable.

## Real Time Data Processing using Spark Streaming | Data Day Texas 2015

Speaker: Hari Shreedharan<br />Data Day Texas 2015<br /><br />Apache Spark has emerged over the past year as the imminent successor to Hadoop MapReduce. Spark can process data in memory at very high speed, while still be able to spill to disk if required. Spark’s powerful, yet flexible API allows users to write complex applications very easily without worrying about the internal workings and how the data gets processed on the cluster.<br /><br />Spark comes with an extremely powerful Streaming API to process data as it is ingested. Spark Streaming integrates with popular data ingest systems like Apache Flume, Apache Kafka, Amazon Kinesis etc. allowing users to process data as it comes in.<br /><br />In this talk, Hari will discuss the basics of Spark Streaming, its API and its integration with Flume, Kafka and Kinesis. Hari will also discuss a real-world example of a Spark Streaming application, and how code can be shared between a Spark application and a Spark Streaming application. Each stage of the application execution will be presented, which can help understand practices while writing such an application. Hari will finally discuss how to write a custom application and a custom receiver to receive data from other systems.
