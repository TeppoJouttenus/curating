# Big Picture Goal

Before we jump into the details, we want to explain what we’re aiming for with content curation.  That way you can be creative and proactive in driving towards that goal.

In short, we are creating an awesome discovery experience. There are lots of websites with great learning materials for developers. But we haven’t found any site that aggregates all the best stuff in one place on an on-going basis. We think that the developer community would benefit a ton from such a resource and we’re building it at Outlearn. We’re starting with a handful of hot topics and will create a stellar learning experience for them. Developers can discover content in topic streams where each stream has a continuous flow of awesome, fresh content. As we build momentum, we will expand to further areas.

<!-- @task, "hasDeliverable" : true, "text" : "What websites or services do you personally use to find awesome content? List as many as you want." -->

When a developer comes to Outlearn, we want them to get an immediate sense that Outlearn has all the new “must read” content for the topics covered in our streams. In addition, users must be able to find most of the good content for each topic stream as that content gets published around the web. Because of this, the developers can let go of the fear of missing out. If they visit a topic stream weekly, they can spend 5-10 minutes skimming all the new content and make sure they are not missing anything important that could help them in their work or other projects.

# Tasks

Below are the different tasks for you to do as a curator. Each has estimates for the required time and volume of output. They are meant to give you something to start with but we know that you are responsible professionals and will use your time well.

> Please let us know whenever you have ideas on how to best achieve an awesome discovery experience.

Our plan is to have 2-3 curators for each topic stream. The estimated effort below is for one curator.

1. **Review links**. About 40-80 links / month, about 2 hr / month. Links will be submitted both by individual users and by “foragers” that are created by Outlearn and automatically pull candidate links from sources such as Reddit, Hacker News, newsletters, blogs, etc. This is the first task because we want to review the links submitted by users as quickly as possible. If each curator reviews links a few times a week, the turnaround time will be short.

    When reviewing links, the main consideration is the quality of the resource. We are considering featuring your profile image next to links that you approve so consider if the quality is such that you would want to recommend it to a friend. We expect that you will quickly get to a point where you can open a link and in most cases very quickly decide if it’s in or out. Then there will be some borderline cases. We have a Slack channel for all the curators where we can jointly create best practices for deciding what should be included or not.

    For us, quality means a few things
    * Accurate and up-to-date content
    * Effective presentation
    * Relevant topic for developers

    In addition to quality of the content, please also check that our platform turned the link into an Outlearn module correctly so that the title, description, and screenshot are reasonable.

2. **Submit links**. About 15 links / month, about 2 hr / month. We will not get all the great content from our users and the automated foragers. We rely on you to take a look at the big picture of the topic and add in any awesome content that has come out during a given week. Ideally, this can happen in the middle of any other activities that you are doing because you will come across awesome resources throughout the day. We will feature your profile image next to links that you submit.

3. **Create learning paths**. One path / month, about 2 hr / month. Paths take a collection of link modules and combine them in ways that is more than the sum of the parts. Possible path ideas include:

    * Comparison of different libraries for a given task
    * Common mistakes to avoid when doing X
    * Pro tips when doing Y
    * All the talks in a conference

4. **Tweet**. One tweet / week, less than 1 hr / month. When you find awesome resources, we would like you to tweet out links to them on Outlearn. This works especially well for paths that you and others have created but applies also to links that you would recommend to others.
