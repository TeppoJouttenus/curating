# Big Picture Goal

Before we jump into the details, we want to explain what we’re aiming for with content curation.  That way you can be creative and proactive in driving towards that goal.

Outlearn is focused on serving professional software developers. We are explicitly NOT focused on people who are learning to code for the first time. We're all about the pros, and our content should reflect that.

There are lots of websites and newsletters covering great learning resources for pro developers. But, in our experience, none of them really gather all the best stuff in one place on an on-going basis. That's what we're building with our Outlearn topic stream.

We want every Outlearn topic stream to be the best place to get up to speed and stay up to speed on the topic in question. If there is a learning resource on the web that pro devs interested in topic X really must know about, it HAS to be there in the Outlearn topic stream for X.

Your job as a curator is to deliver on this vision by delivering a superior content discovery experience for pro developers. It's about breadth, depth, relevance, and freshness. If your topic area is indisputably superior to all other web destinations on all these dimensions, you're dong a great job.

<!-- @task, "hasDeliverable" : true, "text" : "What websites or services do you personally use to find awesome content? List as many as you want." -->

When a developer comes to Outlearn, we want them to get an immediate sense that Outlearn has all the new “must read” content for the topics covered in our streams. In addition, users must be able to find most of the good content for each topic stream as that content gets published around the web. Because of this, the developers can let go of the fear of missing out. If they visit a topic stream weekly, they can spend 5-10 minutes skimming all the new content and make sure they are not missing anything important that could help them in their work or other projects.

<!-- @task, "hasDeliverable" : true, "text" : "For the topic streams that you will curate, how many must-read items do you think are published on the web in an average week? No need to be precise but we'd love to get your gut sense." -->

# Tasks

Below are the different tasks for you to do as a curator. Each has estimates for the required time and volume of output. They are meant to give you something to start with but we know that you are responsible professionals and will use your time well. So don't feel too constrained by our estimates.

> Please let us know whenever you have ideas on how to best achieve an awesome discovery experience.

Our plan is to have 2-3 curators for each topic stream. The estimated effort below is for one curator.

1. **Review links**. About 40-80 links / month, about 2 hr / month. Links will be submitted both by individual users and by “foragers” that are created by Outlearn and automatically pull candidate links from sources such as Reddit, Hacker News, newsletters, blogs, etc. This is the first task because we want to review the links submitted by users as quickly as possible. If each curator reviews links a few times a week, the turnaround time will be short.

2. **Submit links**. About 15 links / month, about 2 hr / month. We will not get all the great content from our users and the automated foragers. We rely on you to take a look at the big picture of the topic and add in any awesome content that has come out during a given week. Ideally, this can happen in the middle of any other activities that you are doing because you will come across awesome resources throughout the day. We will feature your profile image next to links that you submit.

3. **Create Learning Paths**. One Path / month, about 2 hr / month. Paths take a collection of Link Modules and combine them in ways that is more than the sum of the parts. Possible Path ideas include:
    * Comparison of different libraries for a given task
    * Common mistakes to avoid when doing X
    * Pro tips when doing Y
    * All the talks in a conference

4. **Tweet**. At least one tweet / week, less than 1 hr / month. When you find awesome resources, we would like you to tweet out links to them on Outlearn. This works especially well for Paths that you and others have created but applies also to links that you would recommend to others.

# Getting Set Up

In addition to the recurring curations activities, there are a few one-time tasks to get you set up.

**Create a user profile**. Much of your activity on Outlearn will be connected to your user profile. You can sign up [here](https://pilot.outlearn.com/auth/join). Then go [here](https://pilot.outlearn.com/profile) to add more info to your profile. Please include

* Profile picture
* Twitter account
* GitHub account
* LinkedIn account

<!-- @task, "text" : "Fill out a user profile." -->		

**Join the Slack group for curators**. We have a private group for Outlearn curators on [Slack](https://outlearn.slack.com/messages/curators/). It's the primary means of communication between Outlearn and the curators. You can also <a id="TeppoMail" href="mailto:teppo@outlearn.com" target="_blank">email Teppo</a> directly with any questions or comments.

<!-- @task, "text" : "Join the Slack group." -->		

**Accept invite to Outlearn admin panel**. The admin panel is where you review links submitted by foragers and users. It is a separate account from your user profile. You should have received an invite but if you have not, let us know on Slack.

<!-- @task, "text" : "Check that you can log in and change your password." -->		

**Send in a short bio**. We will use the bio to highlight our expert curators in our newsletters, on our cite, etc. Please post it to Slack so other curators can get to know you as well.

<!-- @task, "text" : "Post a short bio on Slack." -->		

**Include Outlearn on your LinkedIn profile**. Please add to your LinkedIn profile a new position called Content Curator at Outlearn. The job description could be something like “Manage and develop learning paths for TOPIC and related content”.

![Outlearn Curator on LinkedIn](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/outlearn-content/assets/master/cc/curator-linkedin.png)

<!-- @task, "text" : "Add Outlearn to your LinkedIn profile." -->		

**Complete this Learning Path**. This is obviously a bit meta... but we do think that it will be super helpful for you to complete this Path, including checking off the checkboxes for all sections and tasks. That way you get a good feel for all that the platform offers.

# Communication

The best way for you to talk about anything related to curation is in the [Outlearn Curators Slack group](https://outlearn.slack.com/messages/curators/). This group is shared by all the Outlearn curators and is ideal for us to figure out best practices for curation and sharing what we're learning. If you have a question or a comment, Slack is a good default. Typical discussion topics will include:

* Good ways to identify awesome links to submit
* Criteria for reviewing links, including tagging and featuring
* Feedback on the admin interface or the site in general

Getting to talk in real time is also powerful so we plan on talking with individual curators every once in a while to get your thoughts and feedback in a more high-bandwidth setting.

Finally, you can <a id="TeppoMail" href="mailto:teppo@outlearn.com" target="_blank">email Teppo</a>.
