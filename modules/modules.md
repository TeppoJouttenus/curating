# What Makes a Good Module

Best learning is customized based on the needs of individuals and teams. Current learning solutions make that much harder than it should be. Outlearn unleashes customization through Modules that any developer or manager can assemble to Learning Paths. You are right now viewing a Module called "Finding and Reviewing Links" and you may be seeing it on its own or as part of a Path. This is a native Module where all the content is hosted on Outlearn so it can contain enrichments like sections and tasks.

Outlearn also supports "Link Modules" which are created from links submitted to the platform. They pull some key information from the link target and add in a screenshot to make it easy to see what the link is all about. We expect that early on there will be much more Link Modules than native Modules. However, we want to make Outlearn such an attractive publishing platform that longer term lots of developer authors want to publish natively here.

As an expert in your topic area, you have a natural sense of what makes a resource awesome for professional developers. That's the number one criteria for you to follow when deciding what to include. We want all the best resources for a given topic to be included in our topic streams. When evaluating a link, please consider whether it has:

* Accurate and up-to-date content
* Relevant topic for developers

In addition to all the best stuff, we want to have a comprehensive collection of good resources around the web. These good links will point to stuff that may not be polished or unusually insightful but will still be helpful for developers. This applies especially to content that is unique so that there isn't any better version of the same information available somewhere else. Because we target professional developers who have more detailed and specialized learning needs than beginners, there are usually fewer competing resources available. If a piece of content is the best resource available for a given need, we should include it even if it has some shortcomings.

If a piece of content is so poorly written that it's painful to read or it contains significant errors, then we do not want it at Outlearn. We also do not want redundant content that is equivalent to what we already have. But remember that we are targeting professional who are able to extract value even from resources that are a mix of useful and useless.

It's not enough for us to fill the Outlearn catalog with high quality stuff. That quality must also be obvious to the users. One of the fastest ways to demonstrate quality is to include well-recognized content. We should include all the relevant posts and resources from the official teams developing Go, Angular, Docker, etc. We also want to include as many resources as possible from respected thought leaders who talk at conferences, write well-known blogs, teach online courses, etc. You can read in the Review Links section below about how we feature Modules. Please feature all the content from teams and individuals with big brands.

Potential targets for Outlearn Link Modules include:

* **Tutorials**. We are especially interested in advanced tutorials for very specific needs, such as how to combine two technologies together, how to use something at scale, how to deploy a tool in production etc.
* **Blog posts**. These could be about trends or news in the topic area or related technologies and tools. Opinionated and well argued posts about best practices or common mistakes are super valuable. When someone shares the mistakes they made or how they overcame a challenge, that will be gold to a developer in a similar situation. News can be about the general topic such as Node.js or a specific package as long as the package is interesting.
* **Videos and podcasts**. Learning from videos and podcasts is less flexible than reading because it's harder to scan and skip around. But conference talks and other presentations can still be invaluable and there are also other good things that are available only in video or audio. Remember that some people love to learn from videos and podcasts.
* **Software libraries or packages**. Staying up-to-date on the latest libraries, gems, packages, etc. can be hard work and we can help by including high-quality ones in the catalog.
* **Tools**. Developers are passionate about their tools so links to Atom or Sublime Text packages, build tools, testing frameworks, etc. are great additions to the Outlearn catalog.
* **Anything else valuable**. The list above certainly misses some solid resources that should be included so feel free to add other valuable stuff.

We are currently staying focused on technical resources so we will not include discussions about how it is to work for a startup or cool movies that developers love. For borderline cases, we can discuss what should go in via [Slack](https://outlearn.slack.com/messages/curators/).

# Review Links

When you review links you should check if the original content is valuable and if our platform turned the link into an Outlearn module correctly so that the title, description, and screenshot are reasonable. Out end goal is to have new content appear in the catalog as quickly after publication as possible. We would love for you to review links several times a week.

In this Learning Path we will often use words link and Module interchangeable because each submitted link is turned into a module that either gets accepted or rejected. So reviewing links or Modules means the same thing.

You should have received login information from Outlearn for the admin panel that lets you review submitted links. Go ahead and log in and you will see the screen below:

![Curator Navigation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/outlearn-content/assets/master/cc/navigate.png)

Click on Content Catalog and Review Module. Note that Review Module is just a convenient shortcut to a filtered view of the Links page so feel free to use whichever works for you.

You will see all the links to be reviewed as shown below:

![Curator Link List](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/outlearn-content/assets/master/cc/link-list.png)

Below is a suggested workflow for link review. Feel free to suggest improvements in Slack.

* Use the Suggested Tags filter to find links with tags relevant to your Topic Stream.
* Open up a handful of links in separate tabs by clicking Review at the end of the line.
* Review the first link. Make the browser window wide enough to see the Module preview next to the controls. You can zoom out to see more of the screenshot without scrolling. See a sample below:
    ![Curator Link Review](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/outlearn-content/assets/master/cc/review.png)
* Check that the title, description, and the screenshot all look ok in the preview. If any are missing, misformatted, or otherwise weird, click Escalate. Escalation should be used whether the content is good or not. Outlearn staff will review escalated Modules to see how we can improve our code that creates the Modules.
* If the preview looks good, click on the Generating Link to go to the original content and to review if it should be included in the catalog. You do not need to read it all, just enough to get a good sense.
* If the link content is not good enough, go ahead and Reject it.
* If the content is good, check the suggested tags and make any needed edits.
* Decide if you want to Feature the item. These items will be promoted in our newsletters and in other ways. As a rule of thumb, you can aim to feature about 10-20% of the Modules. You should Feature anything that you consider to be a "must-read".
* Accept the content and close the tab. Opening several tabs at once and closing them after review is much faster than using one tab to load link after link.
* Repeat the review steps for all the Modules with suggested tags that match your Topic Stream.

You only need to review modules that are tagged with your areas of expertise. But if you do see a module where you are not an expert but you notice that it's missing a tag for the right topic stream, you can add the missing tag. Then click Save. This puts the Module back to the review queue with the added tag. This way the right curator will find it as part of their review.

We have a set of keyboard shortcuts to make your life easier:

```
t = focus tag field
f = toggle featured
ctl-a = approve
ctl-r = reject
ctl-e = escalate
ctrl-s = save
```

If you made a mistake in tagging or accepting, rejecting, escalating, or saving a Module, you can re-review it. Just choose the correct state in the filters such as rejected to find the module and then click Review again.

Note that all curators see all Modules no matter what their subject is. There is no easy way to change that because we do not always know which tags are correct for a submitted link. Feel free to review any Modules where you have the required expertise. If you feel uncertain, just leave the Module in pending_review state and another curator will deal with it.

# Tagging

Outlearn uses tags to include Modules and Paths in the right Topic Streams so getting them right matters a lot. We automatically fill in suggested tags based on the content but you should make sure that a Module has the most relevant tags. We allow up to five tags per Module but usually one or two is enough. As you update the tags you can see into which Topic Streams the Module will go. Some Modules will go to several Topic Streams, such as something tagged with `es6` (Pro JS) and `angularjs` (AngularJS).

As you start typing in tags, the page suggest autocompletions. They are ordered based on how often each tag is used in our catalog to help with uniform tagging. Below is a list of most relevant tags that we want to use canonically. They are mostly borrowed from Stack Overflow's canonical tags. If you ever have a question about a canonical tag, you can check what Stack Overflow uses. The tags are always lowercase, always one word with occasional multiword tags hyphenated:

```
angularjs
node.js
tips-and-tricks (use for best practices as well)
common-mistakes
continuous-integration
continuous-delivery
debugging
logging
design-patterns
```

### Miscellaneous Notes About Tagging

* If you review a resource about AngularJS or Node.js that would also benefit people interested in JavaScript in general, go ahead and add the javascript tag.

# Submit Links

We aim to automate as much of the link submission as possible with foragers that go through pre-selected web resources and submit links automatically for review. If you find a great link that the foragers have missed, you can add it in and give us feedback so that we improve the sources and filters used in the foragers.

You can use the catalog search on the main site or the URL search in the admin panel to see what is already in the catalog.

The workflow for submitting links is the same for users and curators. You have to be logged in on outlearn.com to submit a link. Go to our [Contribute a Link](https://www.outlearn.com/links/contribute) page, paste in a link and optionally add suggested tags. We have a bookmarklet to submit links easily and are considering additional ways to submit such as a Chrome plugin, etc. If you have opinions on how to make link submissions as easy as possible, please share them in Slack.

# FAQ - What to Include in the Catalog

This is an evolving list based on questions asked by curators. If you don't find an answer here, go ahead and ask in Slack.

* **Q**: Can I edit the Link Modules before accepting/rejecting/escalating them?  
**A**: This functionality is coming in the future.

* **Q**: What if the content has poor grammar and/or typographical errors?  
**A**: If a piece has substantial content with significant valuable information that you don't think we already have in the catalog, I would approve it unless it has so many typos, terrible reasoning, etc. that it looks embarrassing. If it's the kind of content that you and other devs read in real life, then go ahead and put it in.

* **Q**: Should I include content from software vendors about their own technology?  
**A**: Content from vendors is good as long as it's not too biased. Readers will see who wrote it and take it with a grain of salt. Vendors have every incentive to publish high quality writing about their own technology, even if it's not totally unbiased. But if the piece is just marketing fluff, we don't want it.

* **Q**: Should I include slideshares?  
**A**: The combination of video and slides is definitely the best but many people find value in the slideshares even by themselves. If the slides have helpful code snippets or something else that works  without getting the whole context, then we should include them.

* **Q**: Should I include links to packages/libraries?  
**A**: Let's avoid niche ones and focus on packages that either have broad use themselves or illustrate broadly useful concepts. In learning paths, you can include modules as illustration of a principle even if it's too niche to be included in the main catalog.

* **Q**: Should I include links to GitHub repos?  
**A**: We love good GitHub repos and we have a dedicated content transformer that creates a Module out of the Readme file. However, Modules that are GitHub repos should not make up more than 10-20% of all the Modules in a topic stream.

* **Q**: What do you think about including opinion pieces?  
**A**: Some opinion pieces can be useful for our audience. Pieces that compare two different ways/packages to do something are good, especially if they give solid facts and pro's and con's. Also, discussing why a technology (Go, Docker, Angular etc.) is great for something or not so good for something else is useful as well. We want to avoid clickbait that's just opinion and does not share useful facts for people to make their own choices.
