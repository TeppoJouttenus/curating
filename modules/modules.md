# What Makes a Good Module

Best learning is customized based on the needs of individuals and teams. Current learning solutions make that much harder than it should be. Outlearn unleashes customization through Modules that any developer or manager can assemble to customized Learning Paths. Each Module

Outlearn supports both native Modules and "Link Modules" which are created from links submitted to the platform. We expect that early on there will be much more Link Modules than native Modules. Longer term, we want to make Outlearn such an attractive publishing platform that lots of developer authors want to publish native here. Right now, a key part of your work as a curator is to find and review links to great learning resources on the web.

As an expert in your topic area, you have a natural sense of what makes a resource awesome for professional developers. That's the number one criteria for you to follow when deciding what to include. When evaluating a link, please consider whether it has:

* Accurate and up-to-date content
* Effective presentation
* Relevant topic for developers

In addition to awesome stuff, we want to have a comprehensive collection of good resources around the web. These good links will point to stuff that may not be super polished or profoundly insightful but will still be helpful for developers. This applies especially to content that is unique so that there isn't an even better version of the same information available somewhere else. Because we target professional developers who have more detailed and specialized learning needs than beginners, there are usually fewer competing resources available. If a piece of content is the best resource available for a given need, we will usually include it even if it has some shortcomings. However, if a piece of content is so poorly written that it's painful to read or it contains clear inaccuracies, then we do not want it at Outlearn. As we go along, we will continue to develop rules of thumb for what to accept and what to reject.

It's not enough for us to fill the Outlearn catalog with super high quality stuff. That quality must also be obvious to the users. One of the fastest ways to demonstrate quality is to include well-recognized content. We should include all the relevant posts and resources from the official teams developing Angular, Docker, etc. We also want to include as many resources as possible from respected thought leaders who talk at conferences, write well-known blogs, teach online courses, etc. You can read in the Review Links section below about how we feature Modules and Paths. Featuring helps us highlight content from teams and individuals with big brands.

Potential targets for Outlearn Link Modules include:

* **Tutorials**. These can introduce a new technique, a tool, or a library, and show by example how to put it to practice. They may target a narrow topic or cover a larger project including many different concepts and tools. We are especially interested in advanced tutorials for very specific needs, such as how to combine two technologies together, how to use something at scale, how to deploy a tool in production etc.
* **Blog posts**. These could be about trends or news in the topic area or related technologies and tools. Opinionated and well argued posts about best practices or common mistakes are super valuable. When someone shares the mistakes they made or how they overcame a challenge, that will be gold to a developer in a similar situation. News can be about the general topic such as Node.js or a specific package as long as the package is interesting.
* **Videos**. Learning from videos is less flexible than reading because it's harder to scan and skip around. But conference talks and other presentations can still be invaluable and there are also other good video resources like tutorials or interviews with thought leaders.
* **Software libraries or packages**. Staying up-to-date on the latest libraries, gems, packages, etc. can be hard work and we can help by including high-quality ones in the catalog. If a github repo has a decent readme file, you can link directly to that. You can also link to a post talking about a resource.
* **Tools**. Developers are passionate about their tools so links to Atom or Sublime Text packages, build tools, testing frameworks, etc. are great additions to the Outlearn catalog.
* **Anything else valuable**. The list above certainly misses some solid resources that should be included so feel free to add other valuable stuff.
We are currently staying focused on technical resources so we will not include discussions about how it is to work for a startup or cool movies that developers love. But within the broad category of technical learning material, go ahead and be create. We can also discuss what should go in via [Slack](https://outlearn.slack.com/messages/curators/).

# Submit Links

The workflow for submitting links is the same for users and curators. You have to be logged in on outlearn.com to submit a link. Go to our [Contribute a Link](https://pilot.outlearn.com/links/contribute) page, paste in a link and optionally add suggested tags. We are considering additional ways to make this easy such as a bookmarklet, Chrome plugin, etc. If you have opinions on how to make link submissions as easy as possible, please share them in Slack.

We aim to automate as much of the link submission as possible with foragers that go through pre-selected web resources and submit links automatically for review. What we ask you to do is to find things that the foragers are missing and give us feedback so that we improve the sources and filters used in the foragers. You can take a look at the individual topic stream on outlearn.com to see what's missing. We also have a quick filter in the admin tools to search for URL's so you can see what has already been submitted. Instructions and admin access to search through submitted links are coming soon.

# Review Links

When reviewing links, the main consideration is the quality of the original resource as described in the section What Makes a Good Module. In addition, please also check that our platform turned the link into an Outlearn module correctly so that the title, description, and screenshot are reasonable. Out end goal is to have new content appear in the catalog as quickly after publication as possible so if you can review links a few times a week, that will be ideal.

Instructions and admin access to review submitted links are coming soon.







<!-- # Tagging

If a AngularJS or Node.js resource would also benefit people interested in JavaScript in general, go ahead and add the javascript tag.

When adding new tags, use these canonical tags (mainly borrowed from Stack Overflow). They are always lowercase, always one word with occasional multiword tags hyphenated:

* debugging
* angularjs
* node.js
* tips-and-tricks (use for best practices as well)
* common-mistakes
* continuous-integration
* continuous-delivery
* logging
* design-patterns -->
