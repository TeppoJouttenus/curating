# What's a Learning Path Anyway?  

There's a ton of good learning content out there in the web, much of it free. Why should a developer use Outlearn instead of just googling? Two key benefits are awesome curation and tracking your progress. Both benefits apply to individual Modules but they are especially powerful for Learning Paths.

The most interesting learning is not about one piece of technology or an individual coding tip. An expert can help you see how several pieces of content fit together into a bigger narrative. Outlearn makes creating such narratives super easy by giving you a collection of Modules that you can supplement with your own Modules and mix in some additional commentary. Here are some examples:

* "X in Action", "Pro tips for Y". [Here](https://www.outlearn.com/learn/vkarpov15/es6-promises-in-action) is a sample for ES6. Our target audience is professional developers and they love to get good recommendations on best practices, tips, and tricks. A path could be about a topic like ES6 in general or could focus on pro tips for a specific area like Promises in ES6.
* Common mistakes to avoid when doing Z. This is the flip-side of the previous category. Common mistakes could be combined with tips and tricks into a single path or could be a path by themselves.
* Comparison of different libraries and tools for a given task. For example, the path could compare testing with Jasmine and Mocha.
* All the talks in a conference or selections around a specific topic. Perhaps you found three talks in the latest GopherCon or ngConf that work really well together and you'd like to explain a bit more about the story they tell.

Outlearn has two different ways to create a Path with a narrative. The easiest way is to use prefaces. See the top of [this](https://www.outlearn.com/learn/vkarpov15/es6-promises-in-action/2) page for an example of a preface. It is an opportunity for the curators to add a few sentences about the module. You can also provide context pages such as on [this](https://www.outlearn.com/learn/matryer/mastering-concurrency-in-go/8) page.

# How Do I Create a Path?

Click on your user image and choose Create New Path. The Pathbuilder is pretty straightforward so we don't include documentation here. If you have questions, please ask them on [Slack](https://outlearn.slack.com/messages/curators/) so we can learn how to make the Pathbuilder ever easier to use.
